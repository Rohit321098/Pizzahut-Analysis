# Pizzahut-Analysis

1. In this project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of Pizza Hut's sales data using SQL to uncover key insights into customer behavior and sales performance.
2. The analysis included retrieving the total number of orders, calculating overall revenue from pizza sales, and identifying the highest-priced and most commonly ordered pizzas.
3. Additionally, I identified the top 5 most ordered pizza types along with their quantities, performed a detailed analysis of pizza category distribution, and evaluated order patterns by hour of the day.
4. By grouping orders by date, I calculated the average number of pizzas ordered daily and identified the top 3 pizza types based on revenue, providing actionable insights for optimizing menu offerings and sales 
   strategies.
